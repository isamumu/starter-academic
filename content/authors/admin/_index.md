As an R&D Engineer at Qualcomm Institute - UC San Diego Division of Calit2, I develop wireless sensing solutions in software with the Wireless Communications Sensing and Networking group (WCSNG).

I recently completed my Master of Science in Computer Engineering at UC San Diego. Previously, I graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Engineering. During my undergraduate studies, I also completed several research internships at institutions, such as the University of Toronto, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and Nagasaki University, where I worked on various projects related to machine learning, FPGAs, and HCI for robotics.

I am looking for new opportunities in 2024 developer roles that will allow me to apply my passion and experience in software development to create impactful and cutting-edge solutions for real-world challenges. I am eager to learn and connect from and collaborate with diverse and talented teams!
