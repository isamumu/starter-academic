I am currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. 

I am interested in embedded systems and applied machine learning. Particularly, I am interested in working with hardware such as FPGAs which apply to state-of-the-art techniques in fields such as robotics, human computer interaction, and computer systems. 

I recently graduated with my masters degree in Computer Engineering from University of California, San Diego. Previously I was an undergraduate student in {{< staticref "https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/" "newtab" >}}Electrical and Computer Engineering{{< /staticref >}} at the University of Toronto, with minors in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. I performed research at the University of Toronto, advised by {{< staticref "https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/chow-p/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Paul Chow{{< /staticref >}}. Additionally, I performed research at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, advised by {{< staticref "https://seng.ust.hk/about/people/faculty/bertram-emil-shi" "newtab" >}}Prof. Bertram E. Shi{{< /staticref >}}. My final capstone design project was advised by {{< staticref "https://www.control.utoronto.ca/~broucke/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Mireille E. Broucke{{< /staticref >}}.
