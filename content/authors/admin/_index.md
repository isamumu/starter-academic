I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Engineering at UC San Diego, to be advised by {{< staticref "https://farinaz.eng.ucsd.edu/home" "newtab" >}}Prof. Farinaz Koushanfar{{< /staticref >}}. I will start working with the {{< staticref "https://aceslab.org/" "newtab" >}}ACES Lab{{< /staticref >}} starting Fall 2021.

I am interested in embedded systems and applied machine learning. Particularly, I am interested in working with hardware such as FPGAs which apply to state-of-the-art techniques in fields such as robotics, human computer interaction, and computer systems. I believe that bridging the gap between hardware and software is necessary to advance the accessibility and security of technology.

Previously, I was an undergraduate student in {{< staticref "https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/" "newtab" >}}Electrical and Computer Engineering{{< /staticref >}} at the University of Toronto, with minors in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. I performed research at the University of Toronto, advised by {{< staticref "https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/chow-p/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Paul Chow{{< /staticref >}}. Additionally, I performed research at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, advised by {{< staticref "https://seng.ust.hk/about/people/faculty/bertram-emil-shi" "newtab" >}}Prof. Bertram E Shi{{< /staticref >}}. My final capstone design project was advised by {{< staticref "https://www.control.utoronto.ca/~broucke/" "newtab" >}}Prof. Mireille Broucke{{< /staticref >}}.
